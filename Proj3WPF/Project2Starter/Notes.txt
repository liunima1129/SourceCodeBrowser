================================================
I created this Project2Starter project by:
1. made a copy of Parser folder using Windows Explorer
2. renamed the project files (vcxproj, vcxproj.filers, vcxproj.user)
   from Parser to Project2Starter
3. Renamed the solution folder from CppParser to Project2Starter
4. Renamed the solution from CppParser.sln to Project2Starter.sln
5. Opened Project2Starter in Visual Studio by double-clicking on sln file
6. Added Executive.h and Executive.cpp to Project2Starter project
7. Copied Parser.cpp's main into Executive's main
8. Did not copy the #ifdef TEST_PARSER nor did I supply one for Executive
9. Copied the include files from top of Parser.cpp to the top of Executive.cpp
10. Provided Prologues for Executive.h and Executive.cpp
11. Included Executive.h in Executive.cpp 
    - for now, Executive.h doesn't have any contents.
